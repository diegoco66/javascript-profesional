Opossum - big, freaky, lookin' bitch. Hey, since when did they change it to opossum? What's up with that? When I was comin' up it was just possum. Opossum makes it sound like he's Irish or something.

You know, like a small, just like a... like a box, you know, to put stuff in. So I wanted to get the thing done as fast as possible. </li>
